<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm 20, working on building my skills in UI/UX, web development, app development, and so on. I would like to be someone
  who can one day spearhead the design department of a firm. I'm working hard on it, and trying to learn as much as I can. I
  am deeplu passionate about this field.
</p>

<p>Right now, I am someone with some basic understanding of Figma, Adobe Illustrator, and Canva. I want to get to advanced levels in
  each and every one of these programs, and unlock the ability to actually bring my ideas to life. Right now, I am confident in my ability
  to make some lo-fi and (given a bit of time, of course) hi-fi wireframes in Figma.
</p>

<p>I am a great communicator, and able to get my ideas across clearly and concisely. I am adept at English, 
  and can confidently speak Hindi and Telugu as well.</p>
